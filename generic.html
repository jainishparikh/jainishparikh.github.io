					During my Bachelors at L.D. College of Engineering in India, my focus was on Machine Learning and
					Data Science.
					I worked on Natural language Processing creating Deep learning mmodels from scratch, tuning and
					playing with them to better understand them.
					During the time of my internship with SoluSoft, I got to know about how an Operations team work and
					what is the process of deploying and maintaining a software/service.
					Which lead me to pursue Masters in USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here at San Jose State University, through academic projects I got learn about various cloud
					technologies and how CI/CD pipelines work. I got exposed to
					technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform. Along with Deployment, I also like to understand
					how distributed web applications work and I got an opportunbity to learn MERN stack
					in one of the courses which exposed me to web technologies like React, Express, NodeJS, Django.
				</p>

				<p>
					I always find myself learning about new technologies and understanding how things work, which has
					given me exposure to fields of Machine Learning, Cloud Technologies, Web Development
					and have broaden my horizons. i look forward to keep learning and keep growing.
